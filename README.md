<img src="image/logo.png" style="width:13%;" align=right>

## Description
CMiNet is an R package designed to generate consensus microbiome networks by integrating results from multiple network construction algorithms. This tool is specifically tailored for microbiome data, where capturing the intricate relationships between microbial taxa is essential to understanding complex biological systems and their impacts on health and disease.

The package employs a range of established algorithms, including Pearson and Spearman correlation, Biweight midcorrelation, Sparse Correlations for Compositional data (SparCC), Sparse InversE Covariance estimation for Ecological Association and Statistical Inference (SpiecEasi), Semi-Parametric Rank-based Correlation and Partial Correlation Estimation (SPRING), Generalized Co-Occurrence Differential Abundance analysis (GCODA), Correlation Inference for Compositional Data through Lasso (CCLasso), and a novel algorithm based on conditional mutual information. These algorithms construct individual microbial association networks, which CMiNet then combines into a single, weighted consensus network. By leveraging the strengths of each method, CMiNet provides a comprehensive and reliable representation of microbial interactions.

## Running CMiNet Package

The CMiNet Package contains four main functions:

1. **CMiNet**: This function constructs a consensus network from microbiome data using multiple methods.

2. **process_and_visualize_network**: This function processes a weighted microbiome network and visualizes it across different thresholds. Each threshold represents a minimum edge weight required for inclusion in the network plot.

3. **plot_hamming_distances**: Calculates the Hamming distance, common edges, and the number of edges for each pair of resulting network matrices.

4. **plot_network**: This function generates a network plot from a final network produced by CMiNet.

As an example, we run CMiNet Package on American Gut data:

## CMiNet Function
### loading the Data
We use the American Gut data from [SpiecEasi package](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi) to run CMiNet algorithm to construct consensus microbiome network. 

First, load CMiNet and the American Gut Project data (included with the [SpiecEasi package](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi)), which is automatically loaded alongside CMiNet).
```bash
library(CMiNet)
data("amgut1.filt")
taxa_name <- matrix(0, nrow = dim(data)[2], ncol = 2)
taxa_name[, 1] <- colnames(data)        
taxa_name[, 2] <- 1:dim(data)[2]       
colnames(taxa_name) <- c("original taxa", "taxa name in figures")
```
### Define the parameter on all Algorithms
We design the package that you can change the paramters of all algorithms based on your interest.
- sparcc_params = list(imax = 20, kmax = 10, alpha = 0.1, Vmin = 1e-4)
- spiecEasi_mb_params= list(method = 'mb', lambda.min.ratio = 1e-2, nlambda = 15, pulsar.params = list(rep.num = 20, ncores = 4))
- spiecEasi_glasso_params =params = list(method = 'glasso', lambda.min.ratio = 1e-2, nlambda = 15, pulsar.params = list(rep.num = 50))
- spring_params = list(Rmethod = "original", quantitative = TRUE, ncores = 5, lambdaseq = "data-specific", nlambda = 15, rep.num = 20)
- gcoda_params = list(counts = FALSE, pseudo = 0.5, lambda.min.ratio = 1e-4, nlambda = 15, ebic.gamma = 0.5)
- c_MI_params = list(quantitative = TRUE, q1 = 0.7, q2 = 0.95)
- cclasso_params = list(counts = FALSE, pseudo = 0.5, k_cv = 3, lam_int = c(1e-4, 1), k_max = 20, n_boot = 20)
### Construct weighted network by CMiNet Function
- Description: The CMiNet function constructs a consensus network from microbiome data by integrating multiple network construction algorithms. This approach combines individual microbial association networks into a single weighted network, enhancing reliability by leveraging the strengths of each method.
- Parameters:
  - data: The input microbiome abundance matrix, where rows represent samples and columns represent taxa.
  - quantitative (default = TRUE): Set to TRUE if the data contains quantitative abundance counts; set to FALSE otherwise.
  - TT: The threshold value used for threshold-dependent algorithms (pearson,spearman,bicor,sparcc,and cclasso), set to the 0.95 quantile by default to promote sparsity in the consensus network.
  - Algorithm-Specific Parameters:
    - pearson, spearman, bicor: Boolean flags to enable these correlation-based methods. When set to TRUE, the algorithm runs on the data; when set to FALSE, it is excluded from the analysis.
    - sparcc, spiecEasi_mb, spiecEasi_glasso, spring, gcoda, c_MI, cclasso: Lists of parameters for each algorithm, allowing customization of settings such as number of cores (ncores), threshold values (lambda.min.ratio), and other algorithm-specific configurations. Setting the enabled parameter to TRUE for an algorithm will include it in the consensus network construction, while setting it to FALSE will skip the algorithm, allowing users to select a subset of methods for analysis.
- Returns: A list containing:
  - weighted_network: A weighted network matrix representing the consensus network.
  - edge_list: A matrix with three columns—first and second columns indicate node IDs, and the third column shows the edge weight values.
  - errors: Any errors from algorithms that could not run on the data, providing feedback for troubleshooting.

```bash
result <- CMiNet(
  data,
  quantitative = TRUE,
  TT = 0.95,
  pearson = list(enabled = TRUE),
  spearman = list(enabled = TRUE),
  bicor = list(enabled = TRUE),
  sparcc = list(enabled = TRUE,params=sparcc_params),
  spiecEasi_mb = list(enabled = TRUE,params = spiecEasi_mb_params),
  spiecEasi_glasso = list(enabled = TRUE,params = spiecEasi_glasso_params),
  spring = list(enabled = TRUE,params = spring_params),
  gcoda = list(enabled =TRUE, params =gcoda_params),
  c_MI  = list(enabled =TRUE,params=c_MI_params),
  cclasso = list(enabled = TRUE,params=cclasso_params)
)
```

  - node_color: Specifies the color for nodes in the plot.
  - edge_color: Specifies the color for edges in the plot.
  - label_color: Specifies the color for node labels in the plot.
- Returns:
A plot displaying the final microbiome network, filtered by the score threshold. Nodes, edges, and labels are color-coded according to the specified parameters, providing a clear view of significant interactions within the network.
```bash
score = 7
WN = result$weighted_network
taxa_names <- taxa_name[, 2]
rownames(WN) = colnames(WN)=taxa_names
network_final <- ifelse(WN > score, 1, 0)
network_final[lower.tri(network_final)] <- 0  # Only upper triangle will have non-zero values
sum(network_final)
plot_network(network_final, node_color = "skyblue", edge_color = "grey", label_color = "black")
