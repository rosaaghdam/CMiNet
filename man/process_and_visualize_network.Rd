\usage{
process_and_visualize_network(
  weighted_network,
  taxa_names,
  thresholds,
  show_labels,
  node_colors,
  edge_colors
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weighted_network}{A numeric matrix representing the weighted network where rows and columns represent taxa.}

\item{taxa_names}{A character vector of taxa names corresponding to rows and columns of \code{weighted_network}.}

\item{thresholds}{A numeric vector specifying thresholds for edge weight inclusion in network visualization.}

\item{show_labels}{A logical vector indicating whether to display node labels for each threshold. Recycled to match \code{thresholds} length if needed.}

\item{node_colors}{A character vector specifying colors for nodes at each threshold. Recycled to match \code{thresholds} length if needed.}

\item{edge_colors}{A character vector specifying colors for edges at each threshold. Recycled to match \code{thresholds} length if needed.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the edges of the network, with columns for taxa pairs and edge weights.
}
\description{
This function processes a weighted microbiome network and visualizes it across different thresholds. Each threshold represents a minimum edge weight required for inclusion in the network plot.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
  \enumerate{
    \item Extracts edges from \code{weighted_network} that meet each specified threshold.
    \item Creates and visualizes a static graph layout for each threshold, displaying nodes and edges.
    \item Exports each network visualization to a JPEG file.
    \item Provides an interactive visualization using \code{visNetwork} for further exploration.
